Any and all content in this repository are for use only after completing Andrew NG's online Stanford Course and should not be viewed while concurrently enrolled.
Viewing of these files during the term of the course is considered cheating and can be punished by Coursera and Stanford online. I do not condone any such activity. 
These files are purely to view how I completed the course and to compare with your personal coursework after completion of the course.
